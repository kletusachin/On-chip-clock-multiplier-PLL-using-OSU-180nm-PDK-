## Introduction
The PLL plays a crucial role in most of the integrated circuits, processor or microcontroller.
The circuit functions to provide a required clock with fixed frequency and phase to the digital
blocks. It delivers the output frequency that is produced as a result of phase comparison at the
input with respect to the reference frequency. Cornucopia of research is carried out on
designing and improving the PLL, the emphasis on the improvement with respect to high
frequency precision and quick locking has been evident among the academia. The design of
PLL largely depends on accuracy in phase and frequency-locking with respect to reference
generated by crystal oscillator with less jitters. The design includes Phase and frequency
detector(PFD), charge pump, voltage controlled oscillator(VCO) and frequency
divider(FD). Fig.1.1 shows the basic block diagram if PLL.

## Theory and fundamental concepts
### Theory on CMOS implementation transistor sizing and system feedback loop
Phase lock loop is a feedback system that generates the signal whose frequency is proportional
to the frequency of the input signal, frequency divider in feedback loop is essentially to obtain
the multiplied frequency as an output of the PLL.
For PLL design, there is a requirement of a circuit that measures the difference between the two
phases, which is achieved by a phase detector. This block compares the input signal phase with
that of the output, by using simple exclusive OR(XOR) gate. XOR gate generates the pulse
whose width that varies with the phase difference between the two signals as in Fig.2.1.



In addition to the basic PLL, a charge-pump based PLL uses a charge pump between the phase detector(PFD) and
loop filter. The output of the PFD is fed to the charge pump to obtain a continuous current at
the output. The charge-pump functions as an electronic switch that is controlled by the states
of PFD. The two outputs generated by the PFD are taken as input to the charge pump, based
on the values of the input given the switches of the charge pump turn on and off accordingly.
Thus always keeping either of the switches on but never on simultaneously switch 1 charges the
capacitor and 2 discharges so voltage change across capacitor determine the phase difference
generated which is shown in Fig.2.2.


Low pass filter suppress the higher frequency signal and passes signal to Voltage Controlled Os-
cillator(VCO) in order to match the output frequency of the system with input frequency. The
basic VCO is constructed using mosfet, Op-amp, resistors and capacitors in our case it is inverter like structure with power fets.
